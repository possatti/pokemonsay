# This is only here because I had trouble building img2xterm (which is now fixed with all the dependencies listed here: https://github.com/Huckdirks/img2xterm) so I had to use Charc0al's cowsay file converter instead, but really didn't want to do it manually for the whole pok√©dex
# This can be used over make_cows.sh, but I think the results from make_cows.sh (by using img2xterm) are better

# This also assumes that you've downloaded selenium and have the chromedriver in your PATH
