# Dear future me,
#
#   If you are in need to maintain this part of the code... I am
# realy sorry for you (T.T). This was the best I could do... But
# I will try to explain things here a little bit.
#   'cat' will read the file and pipe its output to 'sed'. 'sed'
# will filter the html searching for the Pokémon name and its
# image url. 'sed' will output the Pokémons in this format:
# "<POKEMON_NAME>=<POKEMON_URL>". And the output of 'sed' will be
# stored in a variable we will use later.
#   Then, the content of the variable will be read one line at a
# time in the for loop. Within the for loop, I extract the pokemon
# name and the url from the read line. And then, it just downloads
# the content of the url to a file.
#   Again... I'm sorry for all the trouble. But I hope you will
# grow stronger and may be able to turn this code into something
# more readable.
#
#                                                     Kind regards,
#                                           Yourself from the past.
